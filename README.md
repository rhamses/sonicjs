# Prerequisites
1. You will need a free Cloudflare account: [https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up](https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up)
1. Install Wrangler CLI:
```
npm install -g wrangler
```
3. You will need to have four Cloudflare values during the first step of **Getting Started**:
    * Cloudflare account id which is your 32 character id at the end of your [https://dash.cloudflare.com/](https://dash.cloudflare.com/) url
    * For Cloudflare kv namespace id enter the following command in powershell as admin: 
      ```
      wrangler kv:namespace create sonicjs
      ```
    * Cloudflare kv namespace preview id enter the following command in powershell as admin: 
      ```
      wrangler kv:namespace create SonicJS --preview
      ```
    * Cloudflare database id enter the following command in powershell as admin: 
      ```
      wrangler d1 create SonicJS
      ```
If you receive the error:
`wrangler.ps1 cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled on this system.`

Run this command on powershell as administrator and try running the wrangler commands from step 3:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
```
If you already created a namespace and need to see your namespace id do:
```
wrangler kv:namespace list 
```

# Getting Started
```
npx create-sonicjs-app
```

Follow the installation script prompts to enter the required Cloudflare values.

One last step; we need to run the migration scripts to create our database tables:
```
npm run up
```

Now you're ready to fire up SonicJs!
```
npm run dev
```

Open the admin interface at:
[http://localhost:8788](http://localhost:8788)
